# Actors and Movies Information System.

## Prerequisites
This application was created to store and retrieve information on movies and actors that feature in them. It uses a JavaFX graphical user interface.

## Functionality
This program allows to browse through the collection of Movies and Actors and provides information on them. It also provides a simple and user-friendly graphical interface which gives the users to sort search results etc.

When creating a Movie, the application stores information such as: Title, genre, running time, year of release and plot description. It also allows users to add poster image of Movies saved on the system.

* Ability to search for movies and actors by name, range of years and genre.
* Options on sorting of results.
